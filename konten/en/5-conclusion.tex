In this final project, the development of a balance system based on load cells for humanoid robots, specifically the VI-ROSE ITS humanoid robot, is proposed. This balance system uses four load cells on each robot's sole to detect the position of the center of pressure on the robot's sole. The position of this center of pressure is then used to control the humanoid robot's movements so that it can stand and walk stably.
